This: Kirby is updating markdown file here.
```{r, include=FALSE}
#load relevant libraries and data 
library(tidyverse)
gc_df <- read_csv("gc_df.csv")

```

Kirby: Is there a significant difference in reccommended gun control action for male and female respondents (should guns be easier, harder, or the same difficulty to purchase)?

Michael: test change 1

Kirby: data wrangling and counts 

```{r}
#counting how many males and females said about the three gun control options 

get_guns <- gc_df %>% 
  filter(gender != "NA", make_get_guns != "NA") %>% 
  count(gender, make_get_guns) %>%
  spread(make_get_guns, n) %>% # spread the data out based on the value of make_get_guns
  select(-gender)

rownames(get_guns) <- c("Female", "Male")

get_guns
```
